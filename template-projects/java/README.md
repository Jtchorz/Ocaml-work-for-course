# Java Template

This is the Java template for the ID2202 course. Like the other templates,
building happens with `make`, running with `./hello`. The project is built using
[`maven`](https://maven.apache.org/index.html). Maven is already preinstalled
with the dev-shell, or can otherwise be installed from the Maven website or via
your package manager.

To change name of the executable or the main class, edit the variables `EXE`
and `MAIN_CLASS` respectively. When changing the name of the executable,
remember to update the `.gitignore` to ignore the new file.
