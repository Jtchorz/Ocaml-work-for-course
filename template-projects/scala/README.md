# Scala Template

This is the Scala template for the ID2202 course. Like the other templates, building happens with make, running with ./hello. The project is built using scala-cli. To install scala-cli, follow the instructions [here](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install).

To use this template for an assignment, set the NAME variable in the Makefile to the name expected by the assignment. For example, if your main source file is calc.scala, then you should set `NAME=calc`.

Remember to ignore the new file in .gitignore.
